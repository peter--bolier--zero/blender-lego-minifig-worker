Just a basic leog mini figure, still needs a bit of tweaking.

Result of a course:

Nice and relaxed going course, explaining all very well.
For creators with some blender experience it might be too lsow, if you're just starting or forgot most (if not all) short cuts, it might very be well something for you.
