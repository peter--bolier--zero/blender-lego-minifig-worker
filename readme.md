# blender lego mini-fig

Just a basic lego mini figure, still needs a bit of tweaking.

Result of a course: <https://www.udemy.com/course/blender-28-game-character-creation/>.

Nice and relaxed going course, explaining all very well.
For creators with some blender experience it might be too lsow, if you're just starting or forgot most (if not all) short cuts, it might very be well something for you.

I like the modifiers, like solidify and subdivision surface.  
the usage is really shown very well and explained a few times, so you start remembering it. Nice.
