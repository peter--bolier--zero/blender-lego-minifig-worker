# blender lego mini-fig

Just a basic lego mini figure, still needs a bit of tweaking. Some sizes and angles seem a bit skewed, or not good.
It takes some time/experience to get it right, one just appreciates game builders/modellers more...

Result of a course: <https://www.udemy.com/course/blender-28-game-character-creation/>.

Nice and relaxed going course, explaining all very well.
For creators with some blender experience it might be too slow, if you're just starting or forgot most (if not all) short cuts, it might very  well be something for you.

I like the modifiers, like solidify and subdivision surface.  
the usage is really shown very well and explained a few times, so you start remembering it. Nice.

Note:
- the blender fundamentals helped me with understanding the inverse kinteics (IK) stuff.

- It might be a good idea to look for info about the actual sizes, or measure a minifig to get the sizing better / right.
